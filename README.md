# MiniChallenge
Project that i did while i was part of the Apple Developer Academy PUC-Rio! It was mainly to train previous knowledge and learn new things! I wanted to do something with SwiftUi! Hope you like it! 
This was the beggining of an expansion to a private project that i did in the Academy!
